/**
 * Conservative per-channel live tuning for bursty IPTV feeds.
 *
 * Thirty seconds is the smallest target that stayed fully buffered in the controlled Shield
 * tests. A channel that still rebuffers moves one step farther from the live edge, and the caller
 * persists that learned value for its next tune. The cap prevents a broken feed from accumulating
 * unbounded delay.
